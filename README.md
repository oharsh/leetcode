i started this journey on 7 Feb 2024, (it happens to be rose day in India), my initial plan for this journey is to start doing questions on leetcode on daily basis it does not matter which language do i use, but what really matters to me solving questions on daily basis maybe one day i will switch to the cpp but still alot of things to learn before that
